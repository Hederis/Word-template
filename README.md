# The Macmillan Word Template
The Macmillan template consists of a series of Word template files, some of which contain a variety of VBA macros and some of which contain the Macmillan style sets, for use in working with manuscripts. When installed on a PC, the user gets a custom tab on the ribbon from which to launch the macros; when installed on a Mac, the user gets a custom floating toolbar.

The code modules are available from [our Github repository](https://github.com/macmillanpublishers/Word-template).

# Supported versions of Word
* **PC:** Tested and supported for 2007 - 2013. 
* **Mac:** Tested and supported for 2011 only.

We haven't tested anything on Office 2016 yet, but we're working on it!

# Dependencies
The Macmillan template uses the excellent [VBA-JSON](https://github.com/VBA-tools/VBA-JSON) and [VBA-Dictionary](https://github.com/VBA-tools/VBA-Dictionary) projects.
