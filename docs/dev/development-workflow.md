# Detailed steps for merging branches
More complicated than usual because of binary files.

## No merge conflicts
Still should probably checkout binaries, import all modules, add CustomUI.xml or whatever, test, add, commit, push.

Is there a way to be sure that there are no changes that won't be in the template files when closing pull request?
